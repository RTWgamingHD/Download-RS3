# Download-RS3
Simple bash script to download the official RuneScape 3 (NXT-client) without errors for Ubuntu / Linux.

To run, simply open a terminal > navigate to where the folder has downloaded > make 'install.py' executeable.

Example: (cloned to Downloads folder)

cd /home/user/Downloads/Download-RS3

chmod 775 install.py

./install.py

This has only been tested on a live .iso Linux Mint 19
