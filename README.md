# Download-RS3
Simple bash script to download the official RuneScape 3 (NXT-client) without errors for Ubuntu / Linux.

To run, simply open a terminal > navigate to where the folder has downloaded > make 'install.py' executeable.

Example: (cloned to Downloads folder)

cd /home/user/Downloads/Download-RS3

chmod 775 install.py

./install.py

This has only been tested on a live .iso Linux Mint 19.

# DISCLAIMER
I, Rev The Wiz, do NOT own any rights to RuneScape or any of Jagex LTD. products. I did NOT build or create any contents within the game. I am NOT an employee of Jagex. This script was compiled from existing commands from the offical RuneScape Downloads page under 'Linux'. I only added packages from debian.org / kernel.org to fix the missing libglew, libpng and libcurl3 error messages.
